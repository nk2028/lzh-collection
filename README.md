# Classical Chinese Collection

Welcome to the classical Chinese Collection repository, a collection of classical Chinese text aimed at preserving and promoting the cultural heritage of China and East Asia. This repository is part of a larger effort by nk2028 to digitise and preserve classical Chinese text for future generations.

```raw
In halls of ancient learning, where the sage
Of China's past would ponder and create,
A language flourished, rich with style and grace,
That spoke of all the world could hope to state.

Classical Chinese, a tongue so rare and bright,
With every word, a tale of wisdom spun,
Its rhymes and metre, like a vine in sight,
Its beauty timeless, as it shines like sun.

And now, in AI's new dawn, a plan is set
To bring this gem to all who seek its light,
With algorithms that analyse and net
Its knowledge, making it a dazzling sight.

So let this repository be the place
Where classical Chinese shines with regal grace.

## Significance

Classical Chinese, also known as literary Chinese, is an important part of the cultural and intellectual heritage of China and East Asia. It was the language of literary and scholarly writing for many centuries and continues to be studied and valued for its historical significance, linguistic influence, and literary tradition.

In the AI world, classical Chinese provides valuable data for Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, allowing researchers to develop and test algorithms for processing and analysing Chinese text. AI can also be used to analyse large collections of classical Chinese text, providing new insights into the language, culture, and history of China and East Asia. Furthermore, classical Chinese can be used to train machine translation models, making it accessible to a wider audience, and to support the study of classical Chinese in the field of digital humanities.
